# College House Rental Platform

This is an online platform designed to streamline the process of college house rental applications and leasing. Built using AWS Amplify, React, JavaScript, and TypeScript, this platform offers a seamless experience for students and landlords to connect and manage rental properties. Thought the start-up this was developed for did not kick off, I thought it would be a good project to share.

- **Leasing Management:** Streamlined tools for landlords to review applications and manage leases.
- **AWS Amplify Integration:** Backend infrastructure powered by AWS Amplify for secure, scalable data management.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with React to provide an intuitive and responsive user interface.
